# XM Cloud Starter Kit (Next JS)

## QUICK START

1. Have a license file in your root C: drive for convenience. In an ADMIN terminal:

    ```ps1
    .\init.ps1 -InitEnv -LicenseXmlPath "C:\" -AdminPassword "DesiredAdminPassword"
    ```

2. Restart your terminal and run (note, up.ps1 script might need to be run more than once if docker gets stuck starting container):

    ```ps1
    .\up.ps1
    ```

3. Follow the instructions to [deploy to XM Cloud](#deploy-to-xmcloud)

4. Create Edge token and [query from edge](#query-edge)
