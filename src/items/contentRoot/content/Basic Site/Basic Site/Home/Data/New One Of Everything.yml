        Multiline Text- Received as Field<string>. Displayed with <Text /> component.
        Disclaimer: Technically, you can use the text from single or multi-line text with any valid html text tag (p, h1, pre, strong, etc.)
        "Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb."
        Yes, this one is a little longer.
        That's because it's multi-line text.
        Jeez. Get with the program.

        <p><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #333333;">Rich Text - Received as <strong>RichTextField</strong>. Displayed with <strong>&lt;RichText /&gt;</strong> component</span></p>
        <p><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #333333;">Apparently, Rich Text also adds a background to the text that it displays. As you'll notice, the background of this particular text is white, and I did not apply that myself. I'm not sure why a component would apply background behind text by default when it's not for a specific layout, but alas, here we are.</span></p>
